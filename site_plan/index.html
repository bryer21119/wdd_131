			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/b07156-533745-9d9171-c4a287"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/b07156-533745-9d9171-c4a287</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>B07156</th>
						<th>533745</th>
						<th>9D9171</th>
						<th>C4A287</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#B07156]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#533745]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#9D9171]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#C4A287]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

			<h3>I chose the arial and sans-serif fonts because they are fonts that will work on my webpage no matter what. I have looked over what the more common fonts are and those two seemed like the best ones to use.</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Arial
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: sans-serif
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat.

				I decided against colored text as I felt that there were already too many colors on the page and adding more would not gain the attention of whoever is viewing my website.

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Prices</a>
				<a href="#">FAQs</a>
			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page]</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the subpage]</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				parent_page_wireframe, child_page_wireframe
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The wireframe is set up to be user friendly. With the site name in the top left corner, an image in the middle of the screen, the Home, Prices, FAQs, in the top right corner, and below the image a way to choose a certain number of items for your ideal rafting experience.
			</p>
			<img src="parent_page_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				The wireframe takes you to a second page that has a layout similar to the first but also shows the user the grand total of what they spent on the rafting trip along with quantities.
